# Install claude-backup for working on it: build the release binary and symlink it
# onto your PATH.
#
# The install is a symlink into target/release, so a later `cargo build --release`
# updates the installed command in place. (`cargo clean` removes what the link points
# at, so rebuild or re-run this script after one.)
#
# For a normal install use ./install.sh instead: it downloads a checksum-verified
# prebuilt binary and copies it, so it survives `cargo clean`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install-dev.sh                 # build, then install to ~/.local/bin (default)
#   BINDIR=/usr/local/bin ./install-dev.sh
