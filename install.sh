# Install claude-backup.
#
# Downloads a prebuilt static binary from GitHub Releases for this platform and
# verifies its SHA-256 before installing. Falls back to building with cargo when
# no prebuilt binary matches, which is why the download and build paths live in
# one script instead of two.
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KCSAbeywickrama/c-backup/main/install.sh | sh
#   ./install.sh                        # latest release into ~/.local/bin
#   BINDIR=/usr/local/bin ./install.sh  # choose another bin dir
#   VERSION=v0.1.0 ./install.sh         # pin a specific release
#   FROM_SOURCE=1 ./install.sh          # skip the download, build locally
#   REPO=owner/name ./install.sh        # a different repository
#
# Gatekeeper note: these binaries are ad-hoc signed, not notarized. macOS only
# quarantines files stamped by the downloading app (browsers, Mail, AirDrop);
# curl and wget do not set that attribute, so a downloaded binary runs as-is.
